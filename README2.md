# Text-Editor

Given a text editor web application the user opens my application in my editor, then the user should see a client server folder structure.

When the user run `npm run start` from the root directory then the user finds that my application should start up the backend and serve the client.

When the user run the text editor application from my terminal then the user find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.

When the user runs my webpack plugins then they will have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.

When the user use next-gen JavaScript in my application they will find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.

When the user open the text editor they will find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.

When the user enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window they will find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.

When the user reopen the text editor after closing it then the user will find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.

When the user click on the Install button then the user download my web application as an icon on my desktop.

When the user load my web application they should have a registered service worker using workbox.

When the user registers a service worker then the user should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.
